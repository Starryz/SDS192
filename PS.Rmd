# Problem set 02 {#PS02}

*Assigned Friday 9/13, due Friday 9/20 at 10:45am on Moodle.*


## 1. R Markdown component {#PS02_R}

* Download the following Rmd template file: <a href="static/PS/PS02.Rmd" download>`PS02.Rmd`</a>.
* Upload the `PS02.Rmd` file to RStudio Cloud. 
* Complete the problem set.
* Submit the resulting `PS02.html` file on [Moodle](https://moodle.smith.edu/course/view.php?id=35357){target="_blank"}. Note: you are only submitting the output HTML report file `PS02.html` and not the original `PS02.Rmd` R Markdown file.


**Hints**:

1. The resulting graph should be similar to the one [here](static/PS/PS02_hint.html){target="_blank"}.
1. For this problem set, I suggest you not try to write code from scratch, but rather take the copy/paste/tweak approach: find code that does something similar to what you want, copy it, paste it, and change it just enough so that it does what you want. As you get more comfortable, I suggest slowly trying to write code from scratch.
