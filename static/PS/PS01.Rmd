Load necessary packages:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(gapminder)
```

The `gapminder` package includes a data frame called `gapminder`, containing information about different countries from 1952 to 2007. Let's explore this data:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
View(gapminder)
```

We're only going to only focus on data for 2007 and save this in a new data frame `gapminder_2007`. We use data wrangling using code from the `dplyr` package. Don't worry if this doesn't make sense for now, we'll cover data wrangling in Chapter 3 of ModernDive. For now, run the following code by clicking the green arrow on the right:

```{r}
gapminder_2007 <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007)
```

Let's explore this data:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
View(gapminder_2007)
```

An alternative method for exploring a data frame is by using the `glipmse()` function:

```{r}
glimpse(gapminder_2007)
```

This data is in fact the same data as in Table 2.1 of ModernDive.

Create plot but do not worry about labeling axes and legend for now. 

```{r}
# Write your code below:

```
