### 2. In-class exercise

1. At a couple of steps in this process, you will be asked to install packages. Say yes to all of them!
1. **Fiddle with RStudio settings**:
    + Go to RStudio menu bar -> Tools -> Global Options... -> R Markdown
    + Uncheck box next to "Show output inline for all R Markdown Documents"
1. **Create new R Markdown `.Rmd` file**:
    + Go to RStudio menu bar -> File -> New File -> R Markdown 
    + Set "Title" to "My first R Markdown report" and "Author" as your name.
1. **"Knit" a report**:
    + Click on the disk icon and save this file as `testing` somewhere on your computer. This will create a file called `testing.Rmd`
    + Click the arrow next to "Knit" -> "Knit to HTML".
    + An HTML webpage should pop up. However, it may be blocked by your browser. If so, in your browser's URL bar on the right, click on "Always allow pop-ups".
1. **Publish this report on web**:
    + Click on blue "Publish" button on top right of the resulting **pop-up html**.
    + Select RPubs.
    + If you haven't previously, create an account on Rpubs.com. If you have previously, login.
    + Set "Title" to "My first R Markdown report" and "Slug" to "testing"
    + You should end up with a webpage that looks like this [one](http://rpubs.com/rudeboybert/testing){target="_blank"}. This is live on the web!
1. **Update your report on web**:
    + Make some trivial change to your `testing.Rmd` file.
    + "Re-knit" your report and make sure your trivial change is reflected.
    + The blue "Publish" button should now read "Republish"
    + Click "Update existing"
    + Your updates are now live on the web!
1. **Bonus**: Play around with different formatting tools in R Markdown to customize your report! Go to RStudio menu bar -> Help -> Markdown quick reference.


**Tips on R Markdown**:

1. Knit early, knit often! If you wait until only after you've added a ton of code to knit and something doesn't work, you'll have a hard time figuring out where the error is. If you make incremental changes and knit after every step, you'll better able to isolate where errors are.
1. If you get stuck, **go through these [6 R Markdown Fixes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P7IyZ4On9OlrCOhygFxjC7XhQqyw8OludwChz-uFd_o/){target="_blank"} first**, then seek assistance. These 6 fixes resolve 85% of issues in my experience.

* Go over ModernDive reading in schedule above. 

*About readings in this course*:

* You are responsible for completing a lecture's readings before the next lecture. Ex: you are responsible to read all of ModernDive Chapter 1 before Wednesday.
* I teach lectures assuming you have not done the readings beforehand. However, if it suits your learning style better, please do read beforehand.
* While you don't need to turn in your learning check answers, I *highly* recommend you still do them. The solutions are in Appendix D of the book.
* If you have your headphones, you may listen to music during in-class reading time.
